# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**GGRevealer** is a FastAPI web application that de-anonymizes GGPoker hand history files by matching them with PokerCraft screenshots using Google Gemini Vision API for OCR. The system outputs PokerTracker-compatible hand history files with real player names.

**Tech Stack**: Python 3.11+ • FastAPI • SQLite • Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision • Vanilla JS + Bootstrap 5

## User Preferences

- Prefer simple language
- Want iterative development
- Ask before making major changes
- Prefer detailed explanations

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start the server (port 5000)
python main.py

# Alternative with uvicorn directly
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload

# Quick restart (kills port 8000 and restarts - NOTE: restart.sh uses port 8000, main.py uses port 5000)
./restart.sh
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run CLI test suite (tests parser, writer, and API key configuration)
python test_cli.py

# Run matching tests
python test_matching_simple.py
python test_job3_matching.py
python test_full_matching.py
```

### Environment Setup
Create `.env` file with:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Get API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

## Architecture & Data Flow

### Core Pipeline (main.py:740-1144 `run_processing_pipeline`)

1. **Parse TXT files** → Extract hand histories using `GGPokerParser.parse_file()`
2. **OCR Screenshots** → Parallel async processing (10 concurrent) with `ocr_screenshot()`
3. **Match Hands** → Primary key matching using Hand ID (with normalization), fallback to 100-point scoring
4. **Generate Mappings** → Build seat-based anonymized_id → real_name mappings with duplicate detection
5. **Write Outputs** → Generate per-table TXT files with 14 regex replacement patterns
6. **Validate & Classify** → Split into `_resolved.txt` (clean) and `_fallado.txt` (has unmapped IDs)
7. **Create ZIP archives** → Package resolved and failed files separately
8. **Persist Logs** → Save structured logs to database for debugging

### Key Modules

**parser.py** - GGPoker hand history parser
- Extracts hand ID, timestamp, seats, positions, board cards, actions
- Supports both cash games and tournaments
- Detects 3-max vs 6-max table formats

**ocr.py** - Google Gemini Vision OCR
- 78-line optimized prompt for poker screenshot analysis
- Extracts: hand ID, player names, hero cards, board cards, stacks, positions
- Async processing with semaphore-based rate limiting (10 concurrent requests)
- Returns `ScreenshotAnalysis` dataclass

**matcher.py** - Intelligent hand-to-screenshot matching
- **PRIMARY**: Hand ID matching from OCR (99.9% accuracy) - `screenshot.hand_id == hand.hand_id`
- **FALLBACK**: 100-point scoring system (hero cards 40pts, board 30pts, timestamp 20pts, position 15pts, names 10pts, stack 5pts)
- Prevents duplicate matches with `matched_screenshots` tracking
- Returns `HandMatch` objects with auto-generated seat mappings

**writer.py** - Output generation with PokerTracker validation
- **14 regex patterns** for name replacement (most specific first):
  1. Seat lines: `Seat 1: PlayerID ($100 in chips)`
  2. Blind posts: `PlayerID: posts small blind $0.1` (MUST come before general actions)
  3. Actions with amounts: `calls/bets/raises $10`
  4. Actions without amounts: `folds/checks`
  5. All-in actions: `raises $10 to $20 and is all-in`
  6-14. Dealt to, collected, shows, mucks, doesn't show, summary, uncalled bet, EV cashout
- **CRITICAL**: Never replaces "Hero" (PokerTracker requirement)
- **10 validations**: Hero preservation, line count, hand ID, timestamp, currency symbols, summary section, table info, seat count, chip format, unmapped IDs detection

**database.py** - SQLite persistence
- **jobs** table: Tracks status (pending/processing/completed/failed), file counts, statistics, processing time
- **files** table: Uploaded TXT and screenshot references
- **results** table: Final outputs, mappings JSON, stats JSON
- **screenshot_results** table: Per-screenshot OCR success/failure, match counts, errors (diagnostic granularity)
- **logs** table: Structured logs with job_id, level, timestamp, message, and extra_data (JSON)

**logger.py** - Structured logging system
- Job-specific loggers with console output and database persistence
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Buffered logging with `flush_to_db()` for batch persistence
- Colored console output for different log levels

### File Classification System (CRITICAL - Never Lose Hands)

ALL hands from input TXT files are included in outputs. Files are classified per-table:

- **`_resolved.txt`** → 100% de-anonymized, ready for PokerTracker import (packaged in `resolved_hands.zip`)
- **`_fallado.txt`** → Contains unmapped anonymous IDs, needs more screenshots (packaged in `fallidos.zip`)

The system tracks `unmapped_ids` list per file and provides transparent reporting in UI.

### API Endpoints (main.py:84-738)

**Core Workflow:**
- `POST /api/upload` → Upload TXT files + screenshots, creates job
- `POST /api/process/{job_id}` → Start background processing (supports reprocessing completed/failed jobs)
- `GET /api/status/{job_id}` → Real-time status with OCR progress (ocr_processed/ocr_total), statistics, successful_files, failed_files
- `GET /api/download/{job_id}` → Download `resolved_hands.zip` (clean files)
- `GET /api/download-fallidos/{job_id}` → Download `fallidos.zip` (files with unmapped IDs)
- `GET /api/jobs` → List all jobs
- `DELETE /api/job/{job_id}` → Delete job and files

**Debugging & Diagnostics:**
- `GET /api/job/{job_id}/screenshots` → Detailed screenshot results (OCR errors, match counts)
- `GET /api/debug/{job_id}` → Comprehensive debug information (job, files, results, logs)
- `POST /api/debug/{job_id}/export` → Export debug info to JSON file in `storage/debug/`
- `POST /api/debug/{job_id}/generate-prompt` → Generate AI-powered debugging prompt using Gemini 2.5 Flash (analyzes job metrics, errors, and provides actionable debugging steps)

**Frontend:**
- `GET /` → Redirect to `/app`
- `GET /app` → Serve main application page (Jinja2 template)

## Critical Implementation Rules

### Name Replacement Order (writer.py:174-282)
Regex patterns MUST be applied in this order to avoid ID conflicts:
1. Blind posts BEFORE general actions (prevents `: posts` from matching other patterns)
2. Actions with amounts BEFORE actions without amounts
3. Most specific patterns (with lookaheads/negations) first

### Hero Protection (writer.py:168-169)
```python
if anon_id.lower() == 'hero':
    continue  # NEVER replace Hero - PokerTracker requirement
```

### Unmapped ID Detection (writer.py:78-98, 373-395)
- Pattern: `\b[a-f0-9]{6,8}\b` (6-8 character hex strings)
- Must verify context: `^{anon_id}:|Seat \d+: {anon_id}` (not timestamps/cards/hand IDs)
- Presence of unmapped IDs classifies file as `_fallado.txt`

### OCR Parallelization (main.py:296-357)
```python
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)  # Max 10 concurrent Gemini API requests
async def process_single_screenshot(screenshot_file):
    async with semaphore:
        result = await ocr_screenshot(...)
```
Prevents API rate limit violations while maximizing throughput.

### Hand ID Matching Strategy (matcher.py:11-162)
1. **Normalize Hand IDs** → Remove prefixes like "SG", "HH", "MT", "TT" (handles OCR/parser differences)
2. **PRIMARY**: Check `_normalize_hand_id(screenshot.hand_id) == _normalize_hand_id(hand.hand_id)` (OCR extracted) → 100 points
3. **LEGACY**: Check `hand.hand_id in screenshot.screenshot_id` (filename) → 100 points
4. **FALLBACK**: Multi-criteria scoring → 0-100 points (hero cards 40pts, board 30pts, hero position 15pts, player names 10pts, stack 5pts)
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: `_build_seat_mapping()` validates mappings and returns empty dict if duplicate names detected within same hand

## Common Development Patterns

### Adding a new regex pattern to writer.py
1. Insert in correct order (most specific first)
2. Use `re.escape(anon_id)` to prevent regex injection
3. Use `rf'...'` for raw f-strings with regex
4. Test with `re.MULTILINE` flag if matching line starts (`^`)
5. Add negative lookaheads to prevent over-matching

### Modifying OCR prompt (ocr.py:46-117)
- Prompt is structured: CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS → HAND ID EXTRACTION → CARD FORMAT → OUTPUT FORMAT → VALIDATION RULES
- Hand ID is MOST IMPORTANT for matching accuracy
- JSON output must match `ScreenshotAnalysis` dataclass structure
- Include validation rules to guide model

### Database migrations (database.py:95-123)
- Check if column exists: `PRAGMA table_info(table_name)`
- Add with `ALTER TABLE` if missing
- Default values prevent breaking existing rows

## Storage Structure

```
storage/
├── uploads/{job_id}/
│   ├── txt/*.txt           # Original hand history files
│   └── screenshots/*.png   # PokerCraft screenshots
├── outputs/{job_id}/
│   ├── {table}_resolved.txt     # Clean files (all IDs mapped)
│   ├── {table}_fallado.txt      # Failed files (unmapped IDs)
│   ├── resolved_hands.zip       # ZIP of all _resolved.txt files
│   └── fallidos.zip             # ZIP of all _fallado.txt files
└── debug/
    └── debug_job_{id}_{timestamp}.json  # Exported debug info
```

**Database:** `ggrevealer.db` (SQLite) - Contains jobs, files, results, screenshot_results, and logs tables

## PokerTracker Compatibility

Hand histories MUST pass these validations (writer.py:287-404):
1. Hero count unchanged (CRITICAL)
2. Line count within ±2 variance
3. Hand ID unchanged
4. Timestamp unchanged
5. No double currency symbols (`$$`)
6. Summary section preserved
7. Table name unchanged
8. Seat count match
9. Chip value count preserved
10. No unmapped anonymous IDs (6-8 char hex)

Violation of validation #1 or #10 will cause PokerTracker to REJECT the hand history file.

## Debugging Tips

### AI-Powered Debugging (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the built-in AI debugging endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/debug/{job_id}/generate-prompt
```
This generates a Claude Code debugging prompt that:
- Analyzes job metrics (match rate, OCR success rate, etc.)
- Identifies specific problems (matching issues, OCR failures, etc.)
- Suggests concrete files and functions to review
- Provides actionable debugging steps

### Manual Debugging

#### Check OCR results
```python
# In ocr.py, print raw Gemini response
print(f"Raw response: {response.text}")
```

#### Check matching scores
```python
# In matcher.py, already logs to console:
print(f"✅ Hand ID match: {hand.hand_id} ↔ {screenshot.screenshot_id}")
print(f"⚠️  Fallback match: {hand.hand_id} ↔ {screenshot.screenshot_id} (score: {best_score:.1f})")
```

#### Inspect unmapped IDs
```python
# Check writer.py validation output
unmapped_ids = detect_unmapped_ids_in_text(final_txt)
print(f"Unmapped: {unmapped_ids}")
```

#### Review job processing logs
Server console shows detailed pipeline logs:
```
[JOB {id}] [INFO] Starting processing...
[JOB {id}] [INFO] Parsed {n} hands
[JOB {id}] [INFO] OCR completed: {n} screenshots analyzed
[JOB {id}] [INFO] Found {n} matches
[JOB {id}] [WARNING] Unmapped seats: Seat 2 (abc123)
```

Logs are also persisted to database and can be retrieved via:
- `GET /api/debug/{job_id}` → Returns logs with filtering by level
- Database: `SELECT * FROM logs WHERE job_id = ? ORDER BY timestamp DESC`

#### Export full debug report
```bash
# Export complete debug info to storage/debug/
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/debug/{job_id}/export
```
Includes: job details, files, results, screenshot analysis, logs, and statistics

## Critical Bug Fixes & Implementation Notes

### Octal Interpretation Bug in Regex Replacements (Oct 2025 - FIXED)
**Problem**: PokerTracker rejected ~80% of hands when player names started with digits (e.g., "50Zoos", "9BetKing"). Seat lines were corrupted.

**Root Cause**: Python's `re.sub()` interpreted escape sequences like `\150` as octal codes when using f-string replacements like `rf'\1{real_name}\2'`. Example:
- Input: `Seat 3: 9d830e65 (625 in chips)`
- Expected: `Seat 3: 50Zoos (625 in chips)` ✅
- Actual: `hZoos (625 in chips)` ❌ (because `\150` octal = 'h')

**Solution**: Changed all affected regex patterns in `writer.py` to use explicit group references: `r'\g<1>' + real_name + r'\g<2>'`

**Affected Patterns** (5 of 14 total):
1. Seat lines: `Seat X: PlayerID (stack in chips)`
2. Dealt to (no cards): `Dealt to PlayerID`
3. Dealt to (with cards): `Dealt to PlayerID [cards]`
4. Summary lines: `Seat X: PlayerID (position)`
5. Uncalled bet: `returned to PlayerID`

### Duplicate Player Name Mapping Bug (Oct 2025 - FIXED)
**Problem**: Multiple anonymized IDs mapped to same real name within a single hand (e.g., "TuichAAreko" appearing in multiple seats), causing PokerTracker rejections.

**Root Cause**: The matcher sometimes assigned screenshots to incorrect hands, and the mapping creation logic didn't verify if a `resolved_name` was already used for a different player within the same hand.

**Solution**: Enhanced `_build_seat_mapping()` in `matcher.py` to:
1. Track `used_names` while building mappings for each hand
2. Reject matches that create duplicate names within the same hand (return empty mapping)
3. Allow same player across different hands/tables (per-hand scoping)

**Important Note**: Hero position validation was NOT added because PokerCraft always displays Hero at bottom visually, regardless of actual seat number in hand history.

**Impact**: Prevents duplicate player names by rejecting incorrect screenshot matches at the source. Rejected matches are logged with warnings including hand_id.

## Recent Features & Enhancements

### Hand ID Normalization (Oct 2025)
**Feature**: Automatic normalization of hand IDs to handle OCR/parser prefix differences
- Strips prefixes like "SG", "HH", "MT", "TT" before comparison
- Significantly improves matching accuracy when OCR omits hand ID prefixes
- Location: `matcher.py:11-30` (`_normalize_hand_id()`)

### Structured Logging System (Oct 2025)
**Feature**: Comprehensive logging with database persistence and colored console output
- Job-specific loggers with buffered writes
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Persistent storage in SQLite for post-mortem analysis
- Location: `logger.py`, `database.py` (logs table)

### AI-Powered Debugging (Oct 2025)
**Feature**: Gemini 2.5 Flash-powered debugging prompt generation
- Analyzes job metrics, error logs, and screenshot failures
- Generates actionable debugging prompts for Claude Code
- Identifies specific problems (low match rate, OCR failures, etc.)
- Endpoint: `POST /api/debug/{job_id}/generate-prompt`
- Location: `main.py:418-717`

### Job Reprocessing (Oct 2025)
**Feature**: Ability to reprocess completed or failed jobs
- Clears previous results from database and filesystem
- Useful for testing fixes without re-uploading files
- Endpoint: `POST /api/process/{job_id}` (detects and handles reprocessing)
- Location: `main.py:121-148`

## Known Limitations

1. **GEMINI_API_KEY required** - OCR returns mock data if not configured
2. **Rate limits** - Semaphore set to 10 concurrent requests (adjust if needed)
3. **Hero protection** - "Hero" is NEVER replaced (PokerTracker requirement, not a bug)
4. **Hand count preservation** - All hands from input appear in output (matched or unmatched)
5. **Table name extraction** - Uses regex on `Table 'Name'` format; fails if format differs
6. **Hero position validation disabled** - PokerCraft's visual layout doesn't match seat numbers
7. **Port discrepancy** - `main.py` uses port 5000, `restart.sh` uses port 8000 (update restart.sh if needed)
